NPRapp
=============================

Google AppEngine app that accesses NPR's API and stores favourites in a database

Be sure to add your personal NPR API key before running.
The files app.yaml index.yaml and testapi.py belong in a folder testapi that should be added in Google App Engine.
The app runs locally on the host machine and allows the user to browse and save NPR stories.

The code in testapi.py is based off of source code from: 
  Codecademy's NPR API course
  Udacity's Web Development course
  various online forums
  documentation

The code was written by Robert (Bobby) H. Yankou on March 4-9 2013.
